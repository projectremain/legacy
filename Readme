What resources do we have? If you need admin priveleges or access to these, let me know and run with it!

First to note: Original motivation of Project Remain was not to be a 'content sharing' entity but a 'get things done' entity. This is why we did not go down the route that The 48% went down and why we have fewer members, we did not accept many at first. We wanted to be a youth movement primarily. After this, a new team came in and overcomplicated things, trying to do too much with too little time and resources, turning it into an old school campaign. Donald Trump's success proves, you can do a lot using the 'lean startup methodology' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBlrLqsjIDw. It is ultimately your decision how you want to manage this, but I strongly encourage that. Identify a clear focus requiring very few resources, and a key metric, and work towards that. In my view, first thing is, to grow social media channels & get emails into a Slack.

After starting out as a kind of 'campaign' we decided to become a collation mechanism for the remain movement. A way to collate all causes, and provide a directory (self maintained) for these causes, by organiser and chronology. I think this is the best value Project Remain can add. By connecting the Remain movement, you become a meta-entity. By going meta, you are irreplaceable. By being the irreplaceable entity, and helping everyone efficiently communicate - you ultimately 'are' the movement itself.

It is important though, if you go down that route, that you get members to do all the work. So, get members to submit and maintain the directory and communication channels, whilst giving 'slight nudges' to nudge it in the right direction. Kind of like how when you build an app, you don't tell users what to do, but you redesign the environment they are operating in to predicate a given end you support. In this case, that being an actually 'productive' remain cause, rather than as chaotic a one as at current.
