29th January 2017: We were wrong to quell Project Remain's growth as a Facebook group. The first thing to do, is use 'facebook group invite all scripts: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/group-invite-all/eeajicmampllnpkmfimkhefbndkfeloo and page invite all scripts: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/invite-all-friends-on-fac/inmmhkeajgflmokoaaoadgkhhmibjbpj?hl=en. Have people over for dinner & have them run these scripts on your laptop. Build the page's followers and group members that way. You hit one button and everyone's invited. We need to get to above 50k members, and if you engage with your personal network who are adamant remain supporters to get them to 'click that button', this can be done superfast.
